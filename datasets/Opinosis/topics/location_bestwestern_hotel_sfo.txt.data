the tuscan inn has a good location, within easy walking distance to the wharf .
We loved the location, , easy walking distance to the wharf and cable cars .
00, however that being said if you are used to staying at true Kimpton hotels this will leave you wanting, but again location and price makes this a great hotel, the wine they serve is 2 buck chuck get there early if you want to partake, there were people everywhere waiting for the pourings, so we decided to skip out on this one

 The location is great, I opted for a Fisherman's wharf stay for vacation having stayed near Union square on business in the past and I'm glad I did as it was easy walking distance to Chinatown and the touristy area of the wharf .
Location of the hotel was ideal to explore the know attractions, with just a 2 min walk to the wharf   ferries and the famous cable cars, which transported you to union square  lombard st etc .
 The location is ideal but the car park is really expensive, so if you are ending a trip here, take your hire car back after you have unloaded your luggage and get a taxi to the airport .
This hotel is in a perfect location .
The Tuscan Inn was in a great location a few minutes from Fisherman's Wharf .
 We have now stayed in three hotels in Fisherman's Wharf but the Tuscan Inn represents a good comprise of location, cost and facilities .

Great location to Fishermans Wharf .
 My boyfriend's first response was &quot wow, this is a tiny room&quot , but it was what I was expecting considering the location and that this is only a 3, star property .
Location ,  This is the best part of the hotel .
 The hotel is also very noisy but I guess this is inevitable considering the location .
 If you want to be near Fishermans Wharf the location is great .

 We were very happy with the location of this hotel .
Location wise, it is very centralized, walkable distance to the fisherman's wharf as well as the cable cars at both Hyde and Powell Streets   .

 The first thing I have to comment on is the great location .
This was my 9th trip to San Francisco but unlike prior trips I was with my in, laws and had different criteria for the trip, they wanted to be close to all the Fisherman’s Wharf action and walking distance to the main tourist attractions, this hotel was ideal and the best value we could find in the location .

 The location is within walking distance of fisherman’s wharf .
We were very suprised when we got there ,  the location was great, just set back enough to miss the noise of the warf but within a stones throw of all the action .
 The Tuscan Inn is in a great location in Fishermen's Wharf and our boys really enjoyed Pier 39 .
Great location clean rooms we enjoyed our visit .
 We were a little disappointed with the location of this hotel as although it is close to Fisherman's Wharf   Pier 39, it wasn't very busy in the nearby streets so we didn't feel like lingering in the restaurants before returning at night .

 The location is great since it is only a couple blocks to Fisherman's Wharf, the ferry for Alcatraz, Pier 39, Ghiradelli Square, cable cars, bus stops, and there is a small shopping center across the street with grocery store, etc .
 If you're traveling to SF for the first time and have kids with you I think this is a perfect location .

 The hotel is in the perfect location for Fishermans Wharf and the best activity in San Francisco BIKE THE BRIDGE .
 The location of the hotel is very good .
 Ask to see a few rooms before you check in, because the room size and location can vary between floors and sides .
 All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over .
good location but ask for a room away from the road
good location, close to fishermans wharf, pier 39, ghiradaelli square and cable car stops to union square .
 And the location is perfect for tourists .
Although there is no pool or fitness facility at location, as others have mentioned, passes are available at the front desk for $9 day for the 24 hour facility right across the street that has both gym equipment and a pool .

Great Hotel in a Great Location
 The location of the hotel is excellent ,  only a few minutes walk from the cable car terminal and adjoined by a large Barnes and Noble bookstore with Starbucks for whiling away any spare moments !
The room had a few annoying decorative items , ,  like a four, foot long round pillow carefully placed at the same location on the bed by the maid every day , ,  that seemed spawned by a marketing maven .
 Other than the small room, the location was great and very close to all the attractions of Fisherman's Wharf .
Perfect Location Priced A Little High
 The location is terrific ,  two blocks from Fisherman's Wharf .
It is a 2 block walk to the wharf and the location is very convenient .

 Nice, medium sized hotel in a good location .
This hotel is in a great location in terms of a walking distance to key Fisherman's Wharf attractions .
The location is excellent right in the centre of fishermans wharf, a few minutes walk to all the major attractions and cable car .
 The staff at check, in were nice enough, but unfortunately the concierge was not very helpful, giving us wrong information about our car hire location causing us to get 2 cab rides instead of one .
 Good value hotel for the location .

 Overall though a top hotel in an excellent location .
 We thought the location was excellent, , attractions in San Francisco are not all in one spot, so no hotel will be adjacent to everything you want to see .
Nice hotel close to the action  however, I did not like the location ,  while it was close to the Wharf, the area of the hotel was seedy .
 The location could NOT be better ,  we were 2 blocks from the Wharf !

OK hotel,very small and tight room, nice lobby and good location if you want to be by all the tourists that get drawn to the wharf, the best part of the hotel,  the restaurant downstairs on the corner, a little pricey but good breakfeasts and dinners .
 if you want to be more center city, check out other locations in a different area .
 The staff was friendly and helpful, the beds were comfortable, the rooms were clean, and the location was convenient .
