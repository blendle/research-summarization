 First of all, the interior has way too many cheap plastic parts like the cheap plastic center piece that houses the clock .
 3 blown struts at 30,000 miles, interior trim coming loose and rattling squeaking, stains on paint, and bug splats taking paint off, premature uneven brake wear, on 3rd windshield   .
 Insanely cheap plastic all over interior .
 Disappointed in interior and exterior quality .
 I love the color of the exterior and interior   .
This car is nearly perfect when compared to other cars in this class regarding interior dimensions, visibility, exterior styling, etc .
 Several parts in the interior rattle including the sunroof and some parts of the dash, the radio randomly will eject CDs, etc .
 The interior is roomy, the ride is smooth and solid and yet it has excellent gas mileage .
 The interior looks good but feels cheap compared to my 1997 LE camry .
 The interior is large, the controls are well placed and simple .
 Interior noise level is unacceptable ,  this is one noisy car on the freeway .
 I love the exterior, but the interior is nothing to brag about .
 The interior could use some work to make it not so cheap and plastic looking .
 The biggest complaints are the softness of the seat, the super cheap interior dash plastic and the location of the door pulls, they render the door arm rests useless .
 The interior looks great to me .
 This interior is as good or better than others in it's class .
 The interior is stylish, roomy and has many nice features .
 5 Poor craftsmanship on interior .
 Cheapened interior materials, flimsy steering wheel switch gear, less padding in seats, only a 2, way power passenger seat, plastic covered board for seat, back map pockets, baby, puke yellow fake wood trim, etc .
, all combine to paint a less than luxerious interior .
 Only thing would like to see is that the interior be made more available in the darker   in the SE .
I love everything about my Camry, except for the interior looks, very cheap and the non alloy rims are very cheesy or cheap .
 The car also does not allow fresh air through the vents  if the AC isn't on, the interior becomes very warm, very quickly .
 Looks are great and interior is comfortable, but it ?
 Even the interior has not held up along with the awful wind noise at highway speeds .
 The controls were installed without a problem no cutting of interior plastic, the knee airbag was bypassed .
 Interior looks OK but is built a little cheap .
 The interior is so very quiet, you must compare this car to a Cadillac .
The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .
I like the looks and interior but as described in some of the other reviews it has a hesitation problem when you slow down or brake, and then get back on the throttle .
 Also, the sound system is so poor unless you are willing to spend $3K more to get the JBL and leather interior, which come together .
 Interior quality is very poor .
 Fit and finish are exquisite, the interior is extremely well designed, looks good, fun to drive .
 Sound system is excellent and interior was adequate but the room is awesome !
 The interior feels that of a Lexus or BMW and the exterior is an eye catcher .
 I love its Avalon like roomy interior and great looks .
 I love the interior lighting .
 The exterior and interior are nice .
 Like the looks and styling, both interior and exterior .
 Interior exterior quality is very good .
3 It is a good interior and exterior design and should be copied by other car makers, but the MPG for the 2 .
 Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .
 The styling does not say  Camry  anymore and the interior is mostly excellent ,  door handles are too hard and plasticky, some rattles especially when cold outside, not overly fond of the center console design .
 The Camry has a ton of style and lots of interior room without being to bulky on the outside .
 It serves the purpose in which I bought it, and I really do like the roomy interior and the new styling, but there really is no fun factor to it .
 Horrible quality of interior .
 After driving it a few days, the interior squeaking and rubbing noises increased so much that I drove to Toyota and had the body shop manager check to see if it had been in a major accident .
 The interior is very roomy and spacious and Toyota has given some nice standard features in LE .
 The interior design is excellent   .
 Interior is very nice and quiet .
 Very comfortable, quiet interior .
 New interior is very pleasing to the eye and am happy to have features like tire pressure indicator, side airbags, 4 wheel disc brakes and 16 inch wheels included as standard .
 Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .
 I love the body style and the interior .
 Exterior reminds me of a 530i and the interior is plush especially with the light woodgrain finish .
 The interior is on par with other cars in its class, but not up to the fit and finish of previous Camrys   .
 Examples include fit and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily .
 The interior is top notch and the navigation system is very intuitive .
 Customizable features which don't require dealer help like some brands auto lock modes, interior light modes, etc .
 Interior is simple and well laid out .
 The blue neon center console makes the interior look really cool, every single person that's been in my car loved it .
 The interior is extremely comfortable, and spacious .
 I love the lighting on the radio controls, and the material on the interior, very soft and stylish .
 Interior is very nice and much improved .
 Practicality, good interior space, easy to get in and out of including putting an infant in a car seat .
 Interior materials are far better than my old Mazda and V6 power is nuts .
 I get positive comments each day on the exterior interior design .
I bought this car smitten by its exterior look and interior comfort .
 The interior is classy, the standard MP3 is useful, the host of curtain bags and standard features add to the plus .
 The new design is very aggressive on Toyota's part and the interior design is very contemporary .
 The ride is quieter, the car faster, the exterior and interior looks better .
 The interior is nice and roomy and the exterior design is beautiful .
 Great ride, engine, interior, gas mileage .
 It shifts hard, has a lot of play in steering, has quite a few blind spots & the interior is cheap plastic which scratches very easy .
 The sunroof actually comes down and slides between the exterior and interior thus minmizing wind noise at speed .
 The leather interior is worth the money .
 Luxurious interior, great MP3 player addition .
 The interior is fairly pleasant but suffers from too much hard plastic and some poor fits !
 The interior is very quiet at highway speeds .
 The cloth interior is great and the 4 cylinder has tons of power for such a small engine .
 On top of that some interior trim pieces didn't match and one fell off !
 Smooth and responsive interior is as luxurious as you can get without slapping an L on the grill .
 The first one was returned to the dealer, on the day of delivery, because of excessive rattling noises coming from the interior, especially the back right side of the car .
 The ride is refined, steering is tight, plenty of interior space, the exterior design is refreshing to look at .
 My only complaint with the interior is the color of the fake wood :
 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .
 IMHO, the exterior and performance are way better than other trims, though you can't compare interior of SE with XLE .
 Interior is extremely quiet on the hiway .
 Love the looks, power, roomy interior, good mileage at 32 hwy and 25 city .
 Interior still has too much hard plastic, especially the steering wheel, which has a raised crease hitting on the fingers as a constant reminder .
 It has nice luxury interior  , but it also has nice pick up speed and is very roomy .
 I like the wood grain accents with the tan colored interior   but I don't think is looks as good with the gray interior .
 Excellent interior build quality .
 The new interior design is ok to me, the blue, backgound center console is a little bit awkward, too bright at night .
 Ash leather interior with light yellow fake wood trim is just ok design .
 Leather interior very comfortable .
 The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .
 Nice looking interior but seats are very hard and are not comfortable for long trips .
 There are so many interior improvements and well as engineering improvements .
 I am in, love with my moonroof, 440 watt 6, disc stereo system, and the interior gauges that illuminates in blue is probably my favorite .
This is my second Camry and I like it, especially the art decoish design and simplicity of interior controls .
 My Barcelona red metallic exterior and dark charcoal interior are a perfect combination .
 Top notch rating on interior comfort .
All around this car is amazing, its sleek exterior and futuristic interior is sure to turn some heads .
 Second, the interior designer should be fired .
 It is surprising how spacious the interior is on a long trip .
 The plastic interior looks and feels cheap .
 The interior is okay and I have not had any rattles or squeaks .
 The interior rattles, with pieces falling off, the ride is not that great, and the handling of the vehicle is absolutely the worst I have ever experienced .
