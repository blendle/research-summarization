 Only things I wish they added is measuring distance [not just steps] on the pedometer, better sound on the speaker, and a  capturing still images  with the video recording feature .
 The gym music drowns out the sound .

 The Headphone Jack is bad out of the box, sound crackles with the lightest touch of the headphone jack which makes the radio useless because they use the headphone cable as the antenna .
 Turn the volume up and the sound in the headphone lowers, turn the volume down and the sound goes up .
 Video is impressive, speaker sound is good for size, easy menus, screen is big enough to watch movies .
 the sound quality is very good .
