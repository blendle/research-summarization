 After slowing down, transmission has to be  kicked  to speed up .
 I wonder if the people who have problems with rattles and transmission were built in the US .
 The transmission, I don't know what to tell you, but good luck if you don't learn from my mistake .
I did not notice any hesitation with the transmission until after I read about it last summer, and now I sense a slight bit occasionally .
 I've had the same transmission problems hesitation issues as everyone else .
 I immediately starting noticing transmission surge during 2nd and 3rd gear during first few minutes of driving .
 The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .
 The transmission doesn't shift correctly, and it has almost caused me to get into an accident twice .
 I'm pretty content with pretty much everything the car offers except the common issue of the transmission that doesn't want to seem to work when you need it .
 Unlike the common concerns with the transmission, all of my concerns problems are with everything other than the drivetrain .
 decent power for a 4 cylinder, but a dangerous hesitating transmission that toyota does not seem to want acknowledge or fix .
 My Camry has been in the shop four times for the transmission problem and still has not been fixed .
 First thing that come to me off the top of my head is the transmission .
 The transmission is the worst ever for camry .
 However, there are too many problems with the transmission .
 I have the 4 cylinder with manual transmission .
I've had no significant transmission problems .
Transmission is terrible , ,  acceleration lag is a safety issue .
 Transmission also can't decide what gear it wants to be in .
 Transmission was replaced by Toyota in the first year .
 The transmission feels terrible when it shifts .
 The transmission is crap, and erratically shifts despite modest acceleration and conservative driving habits .
 The transmission shifts smooth at all speeds .
 No sign of the transmission problem people have complained about, but I'm not expecting a Porsche .
 No rattles or transmission problems .
After driving my car almost 20,000 miles I have grown disappointed with the transmission hesitation problem as it did not show during the test drive .
 Had 2 TSBs done to recalibrate engine, transmission .
 The engine and transmission works flawlessly when a particular brand   of fuel is used and I am absolutely sure I am correct .
I have the transmission problem .
 No transmission problems as reported by so many others .
 The engine transmission was a Jekyll Hyde affair .
 Here are the transmission problems I've experienced :
 Transmission is  confused  and CONTINUALLY shifts at speeds of 28 to 35, 38 to 42, and 45 to 51 MPH .
 At this rate, the Transmission will go out @ 37,000 miles right after my Warranty expires !
 Obviously they moved the costs around to provide for the new higher power V6 and the 6 speed transmission, which are so far the car's only redeeming features !
Toyota now has a fix for the accelerator hesitation and transmission problem !
 EG7031 recalibrate ECM   engine and transmission 9159 Bulletin #EG036, 07  .
I'm not sure what everyone talks about with hesitation transmission not enough power ?
The transmission cant make up its mind it hesitates to shift .
 Transmission sticks in fourth gear and rpm surge while using the cruise control .
I am not having all the other issues everyone else is, not sure if its because mine is a manual transmission but I can't say how much I love it .
Toyota may have computerized the engine and transmission to get better gas mileage but the very best I can get is 25 mpg on the highway .
 While in cruise control and going up a slight incline the transmission is constantly shifting and the rpm goes up and down by as much as 1500 rpm .
 While driving on a straight and level road at about 40 mph the transmission is changing gears .
Loved the car but two transmissions failed within 19000 miles before I got rid of the car .
 The transmission design has major problems and so did the replacement .
 My dealer told me the new transmissions were on back order and couldn't even give me an ETA .
The side front windows limit visibility, the transmission hesitates when shifting, the back seat passenger room is spacious, the stereo system has a great bass and the versatility of CD changer, satellite, iPod, etc .
 My transmission works perfectly fine, is fun to shift but does better on its own .
 below the advertised numbers, and a jerky, balky, surging transmission that is difficult to use .
 Terrible transmission that doesn't shift right .
 the significant transmission hesitations are unacceptable and possibly unsafe, and the 4 cyl engine provides inadequate power when challenged .
 I feel the plusses outweigh the negatives, but any prospective buyer should take a serious test drive under varying conditions and actually experience transmission hesitations and the mediocre acceleration performance .
 After one week, I found a rusted conjunction block, which mounts the transmission .
 BTW, this is an auto transmission .
 I hate the transmission as it always hesitates to downshift when the power and speed is needed .
 No problems with the transmission at all .
 I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .
 There have also been a few isolated incidences where I have noticed a delayed surge in the transmission, which once put me in a potentially dangerous situation .
 No transmission flares, hesitations, rattles or any other problems .
I had one for a year, Toyota was good to replace the two transmissions that failed, I was on my 3rd tranny, when my engine light came on due to a sensor in the tranny .
 The gas pedal & transmission are out of sync .
 At lower speeds when you try to give it gas an intermittent delay occurs between the gas pedal & transmission .
 Acceleration or transmission shifting :
 Quiet and refined ride, 4 cyl has sufficient power for everyday driving, and a smooth transmission that shifts well .
 Transmission not nearly as smooth as previous 4 speed .
 The transmission does occasionally get  confused  and takes a while to select the right ratio, but this does not occur frequently .
 The transmission is weak, you need to think twice before jumping into traffic .
 Obviously since I got the manual transmission I haven't had any problems with acceleration or anything like that .
 Transmission has a very strange hesitation when shifting .
Performance stinks due to transmission, always looking for another gear, constantly jerking, dash lights always dimming, lower grill always slipping out .
 When we returned home, I took the car to a transmission specialist and found out that the transmission is slipping .
 Rattles, squeaking, and transmission troubles started shortly after .
 It's VERY bothersome when the transmission down shifts the second one brakes when going down a mountain .
 The speed control as well is balky in that the slightest uphill grade causes the transmission to down shift .
 The accelerating is great, the transmission is smooth, it handles well and breaking is excellent .
I loved my '05 Camry 4 cyl automatic transmission LE, but I hate my '07 Camry 4 cyl automatic transmission LE .
 Many people have mentioned a hesitation in the transmission  I haven't seen it .
 No transmission problems, reacts instantaneously .
 However, the transmission is a little confused at times during downshifting .
 I have had issues with the new 6 speed transmission, there is a  shift flare  between 3rd and 4th gear with my car .
 Toyota is aware of the problem   and they are actually replacing my transmission since they cannot figure out what the cause is .
 Hopefully once I get a new transmission, it will be OK .
 The combination of the weak engine   at low engine speeds and the transmission hesitation is so bad that the car is, in my opinion, a safety hazard .
 Dealer recalibrated ECU, engine and transmission .
 Test drove identical camry at a different dealer  transmission reacts same way .
 Transmission slips, especially when the car is cold .
 Transmission replacement did not resolve the problem .
 Transmission is exceptionally smooth other than the first few shifts on a cold winter morning .
 Cruise control gains, RPMs accelerate up hill causing engine to make loud noise while using cruise control, higher in back making it harder to judge while backing up and transmission not completely smooth in take offs .
 The six speed auto transmission is very smooth .
After driving this car for a month it is very obvious to me that there is a design flaw in the transmission .
 The transmission constantly shifts back and forth between gears .
 The transmission is just terrible .
 Transmission is a little different than previous Camrys   but MPG and better accel .
 It has plenty of power for my needs and I have noticed no transmission problems at all .
Like everyone else, I have the problem with the transmission .
 I have had non, stop transmission problems, terrible sunroof noises, very uncharacteristic squeaks and rattles from everywhere in the dash, and unacceptable paint issues .
 It has been in for a rattling sunroof pan within 1 month of purchase  3 trips for a transmission issue  the radio quit working this summer and needed replaced and now the oil line for the VVTi has ruptured .
 The transmission leaves a lot to be desired .
 Some have found the transmission shifts too much, but it's only trying to keep the engine in the 2000, 2500 rpm range around town where there's some torque available .
 Toyota made a real goof on the engine and transmission !
 Transmission shifts up and down at highway speeds, which is annoying .
 However, the transmission is sloppy .
 It's automatic transmission is jerky and sometimes hesitant about changing gears .
 MPG is not better than 24mpg w the 4CYL, the transmission slips, the throttle by wire has been non,  responsive on several occasions, the ergonomics are  off , and the dealership is very proud of their product, too proud .
 Also, the shifting in the transmission is herky jerky .
 the auto transmission is very poorly designed and Toyota hasn't decided what to do .
 When approaching a stop with little or no gas pedal pressure, the transmission downshifts normally until the car shifts gears and suddenly lurches ahead at a higher speed .
After purchasing my 2007 Camry, which was a hassle because the salesman was pushy, I started having trouble with the transmission slipping !
 The transmission hesitates, also downshifts, hunting between gears, then lurches   .
 The engine has a horribly long hesitation when trying to accelerate and the transmission downshifts with the slightest throttle pressure and on the most minor upgrades .
 The only negative is the shifting of the transmission from 40
 The transmission is the nightmare many have already talked about .
 Perhaps the most annoying thing to me, the transmission kicks up and down on shallow declines ,  never had this in any automatic before .
 If you care about a smooth transmission run don't walk away from the 4cyl automatic 2007 camry .
LE 2007, 4cy, minor transmission hesitations as I see many other are experencing .
 Transmission does not know sometimes what it is doing when it ?
Surprisingly agile for a 4 cyl, auto transmission requires manual downshift for quick instant power .
 The transmission is flawed, it takes a few seconds for it to speed up, but once it goes it goes fast, I love the shift gate, great for easy passing !
 Due to lack, of, power or transmission problem, car down, shifts revs to 3000
 Transmission is smooth and the 2 .
 I did have a problem with the transmission but took it in and they reprogrammed the 2 computer chips in there and WOW what a difference that made .
 Power is great, transmission shifts are smooth and accurate .
 Instead of giving me a new car they finally admitted the problems with transmission and replaced it with a new one, free of cost to me   cost to them .
The transmission and cruise control is a joke .
 The transmission hesitates and stumbles .
After about 3000 miles on my 2007 Camry XLE V6 6sp Auto, it's been in the shop 4 times already and the last call from the dealer was to replace the transmission .
 transmission hunts for gears, ride quality much worse than even a mediocre car, Auto sound level doesn't work, accessory outlets do not work unless car is running or acc is on  , radio shuts off when engine is shut off .
 The transmission is not the smoothest .
 268 HP V6 with 6 speed auto transmission is very responsive and smooth .
 The transmission is seamless and, with six forward gears, the engine is virtually never strained in ordinary driving .
 8 Transmission hunts for gears 9Driver side head liner molding buzzes .
 11Transmission unexpectly deaccelates during a slow down   .
 However I have noticed, like others, that the new transmission is not that smooth, especially when accelerating from a stop .
 It can occasionally accelerate quickly and jerk you ahead, or hesitate, and sometimes I've noticed the car slow down unnaturally via the transmission .
 The 5 speed transmission shifts like one would with a manual .
 The transmission, or more specifically, the power transfer is scary .
 The reprogramming of the transmission shifting seemed to help for awhile, but it's reverted back .
 I'll probably sell it to avoid an expensive transmission repair after the extended warranty expires .
 The transmission computer is a major issue .
 Dealers do not handle the transmission matters well as I've had no luck in clearing up the inadequacies .
 After researching on the internet I found that the computer for the transmission needed reprogrammed   .
 The transmission is jerky and the gas mileage is terrible .
 It has major transmission issues, which I have had fixed twice .
 My transmission works seamlessly and there are no quality issues whatsoever .
 The transmission is  driving  me crazy .
 While the transmission is downshifting you can feel it thumping through the gears and an audible banging sound can be heard coming from the trans .
 Transmission was very rough, dealership re, programmed, it's ok now .
 The new transmission shifts too frequently to truly optimize gas consumption .
 The transmission is the absolute WORST, it is very dangerous and can cause an accident .
 They have finally fixed my transmission .
 Only problem has been the proprietary transmission glitch everyone talks about .
 I have 4 cyl with manual transmission ,  lack of power but great fuel economy .
 Transmission big issue and also rattles more than the 2001 Avalon that had 175K miles
