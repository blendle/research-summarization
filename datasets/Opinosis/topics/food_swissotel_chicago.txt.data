 The food for our event was delicious .
 The food in the lounge was great and very fresh, , , salads, sandwiches etc .
 As far as food, walk a few blocks toward Michigan Ave turn left or right and there are plently of less expensive places to eat .
 The Palm resturant in the hotel had some specials Sunday night, we ate there and the food service,etc were outstanding portions are large and we shared since we are not big eaters .
 Took the charge of the minibar which we had used to keep my 2 year old sons food .
 We never ate anything onsite so I can't vouch for the food options immediately avialable .
 The Lobby bar does not serve food very late at night and we couldn't find any vending machines for soda or snacks, so stop at a nearby market before going in for the night .
 In any case, I had allotted approximately $150 for “food” for 4 days 3 nights .
 But the presentation was awesome and the food was so good and not having to walk in the dark at night and scare my mother or pay for a taxi or bus, but sit around and eat comfortably in my pajamas was well worth the cost to me .
 The food was delicious and the view was fabulous .
 For self catering types, Bockwinkels is a well stocked mini grocery 2 blocks south and 1 block east on street level for snacks, drinks and all kinds of deli prepared foods, plus the Aon Center's underground food court 2 blocks south and 2 .
 Room service was extortionate though, very very expensive, so we didnt bother, as food outlets a few minutes walk away .
 We also did the chicago food tasting tour which you can find here on travelzoo, this was fantastic and well worth the $40 pp .
 So if you move around bottles in the fridge so that you can store your own food personal items, the sensor will send a signal to the hotel and you will be charged .
 We passed on the restaurants simply because the cost of breakfast was insane and the food tends to be mediocre .
 Also don't forget to go the &quot The River North&quot  for great food .
 An added bonus was the Executive Lounge with complimentary food throughout the day .
 Room service food quality was very good but with a $7 tray charge plus 20% service, I then absolutely refuse to tip for delivery .
 there is a market one block south of the Hyatt that has wine beer and food for reasonable prices until 2am, and a Dominick's   grocery store across the river open til 1am .
 Had an appetizer at the Lobby Lounge, and the food came from the Palm Restaurant .
 The hotel buffet had fabulous food .
 I didn't dine in the hotel, so I can't tell you about the food .
 We enjoyed the breakfast although the other evening food service was a bit skimpy .
 Room service got my breakfast order wrong but they made it up the next day when I ordered a kids meal and got enough food for three people .
 I was delighted as the waiters were very friendly and the seafood was delicious .
 mile with traditional Italian food and a great atmosphere .
 A nice restaurant with reasonable prices and great food .
 Good but pricey food, great breakfast .
 My only complaint is the Palm restaurant, it is expensive and the food not very good .
 If you want good food at a decent price, there is a restaurant called Houlihan's down the street from the hotel on Wacker St .
 We ordered room service for late night ice cream and fruit and also breakfast and it was prompt and very excellent food .
Ed Debevics is fun, , sassy servers, diner food, total check about $30 for all four of us .
Brain Food Cafe in the museum of Science and Industry, , sounds crazy I know but it was the best museum food ever .
 No line, a plate full of REAL food with drink included for $7 each .
Staying with food, try also the Weber Grill, N .
The few complaints I had were as follows ,  refrigerator was stocked with food that was weight sensitive .
 But the food was good and fresh .
 Very friendly servers and nice selection of food at a reasonable price .
 We called several times and within 30 minutes our food was at the door .
 The Italian food was superb .
 My wife and I are food snobs, and this place really was a treat .
 Very much enjoyed the Chicago Food Tour, a walking tour that incorporates food tastings at various places like a bakery, traditional deli, pizza, chocolate lounge, etc .
 Room service was efficient, average priced, and decent food .
 I ate their last night and the food and service were top noch .
I had a great experience here from the quality of the lobby, to the quality of the room, to the view, to the room service, to the food .
 The hotel is advertised to have multiple restaurants, but that was not the case either , ,  other than room service the only option for dinner is The Palms restaurant which is very overpriced for the quality of the food .
 There's an escalator that goes into the basement where you'll find a nice upscale restaurant and a long walkway concourse that leads to an underground mini, mall, with a grocery store, fast, food restaurants, barber shop etc .
, followed shortly thereafter by a knock and a housekeeper telling us our sign wasn't out  the hotel's extremely limited cable service    our housekeeper didn't refill replace our shampoo or shower gel our entire stay, nor did she empty all of our trash bins at any one time  our room service on two occasions brought us cold soggy, , and very late, , food  the lobby bar closes at 9 p .
 Food unexceptional although the breakfast buffet in the basement restaurant   was of good quality .
 We were able to get a crib, a play pen, and a small room refrigerator for storing baby food at NO additional cost .
 The food at the Swissotel is better than the average hotel but nothing special .
