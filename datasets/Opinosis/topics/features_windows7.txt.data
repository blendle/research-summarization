 I had to uninstall anti, virus and selected other programs, some of which did not have listings in the  Programs and Features  Control Panel section .
 This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS .
 All of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience .
I enjoyed the new convenience features in Windows 7 .
 They showed me PC laptops that had more features than the MacBook, and which cost way less than the MacBook, too .
 But that aside, I like the availability of software, the new features like the improved Taskbar, Windows Peek, and the Aero environment .
If you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that .
 After seeing the pricing on the newest MacBooks this week, and the limited features compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC .
 These new features make the user experience much more superior than anything Windows has ever offered .
 Also there are some other new things such as touch gesture features and disk encryption that normal users won't use either because it isn't needed or the hardware isn't widely adopted yet   .
 You can read all the new features in your Windows 7 short version handbook .
 But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers .
Also in Windows Explorer, two new features .
All the nifty new features mean squat if my computers don't function properly .
, then Vista, but if so, none of its features have been impressive enough to have blown me away .
 It does have some nice features .
 W7 is fast and resource friendly, every hardware device works perfect  , and there's a ton of great features .
 Runs well, but no stand out new features for my usage .
Having used Windows ME and XP for several years, and before upgrading, Vista, I heard a lot of great things about Windows 7, as well as new features .
 I liked the built, in features of Vista and of course the appearance, but I prefered the stability and speed of XP even with a high, end system .
,  Better user interface features like being able to view the desktop with one mouse gesture to the bottom right of the screen .
LEAST useful features of Windows 7 to me :
 They're features I don't use .
 Windows 7 Ultimate is there too off course, but I personally can't bring myself to spend that much more money just to get a tiny few features that I know I will never use like multi, language support and BitLocker .
 It's loaded with useful features .
 It has some features that I personally don't find useful, BUT if in the future I do need them, they're there .
 There are many features that allow me to personalize my working environment .
   Vista has more features than XP, but many of them didn't make the OS more usable for me .
 Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .
 I haven't yet become accustomed to some features like Aero Shake, but hey, those things are there if I need them .
I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .
 Did I mention that Win7 offers nothing in terms of any new worthwhile features ?
0 out of 5 stars XP speed & stability, Vista, like features without the headaches !
 I really wanted to like Vista with all it's cool new features, but unfortunately it was a disaster because it just didn't work .
 And I love all the new Aero Shake Peek Snap windows features, but I still prefer Mac OS X's Expose .
,  New features with better window and file managment
,  Many features are copied from Mac OS X
 Of course there are some new features, and a little more eye candy if that's important to you too .
 Nice upgrade and love some of the new features, snip tool, sticky's on the desktop, Docking on the task bar and thanks for clearing the clutter on the Tray .
 W7 has some cool features that I like, and I'm sure I don't even know the half of it yet .
 I don't have a TV Tuner, so I can't take advantage of that feature, but there are other features & it seems to be working good .
00 dollars just to upgrade for some fancy new features .
 Since my Google Sidebar had some features that I liked, it allowed me to replace it for the Windows one .
 Because others on this site have already described in sufficient detail all the amazing features of W7, I will not repeat them .
 There are so many more features of this that are very difficult to list all here .
 All   of these features have worked 100% of the time, which is previously unheard of .
 Removing a  feature  from the Programs and Features panel simply disables access to it, but the underlying program files associated with that feature remain on the hard, drive taking up space .
 I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used .
All the features of Vista, but without any of the problems .
 It still works pretty good though, just a lack of some features that i had before .
 What I will highlight are a few features of Windows 7 which I have been thoroughly impressed with .
 Perhaps my expectations were low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .
 I do not use most of the features, such as gaming, that seem to benefit most from the upgrade .
Does the new operating system have cool features ?
 My only complaint would be that I would like to have a family pack available in the Windows Professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately .
 Seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .
 I think the reason it didn't is because it wants to force the user to use the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .
Smooth OS with great little features .
 A lot of the new finder desktop windows features are awkward working versions of what Mac OS X has had for a couple of years or more .
 If you didn't come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool, so enjoy them for what they are if you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .
 I am not going to review the features, because there's plenty of that already .
There is not a lot of new features in the operating system .
