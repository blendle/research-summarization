 The Eee Super Hybrid Engine utility lets users overclock or underclock their Eee PC's to boost performance or provide better battery life depending on their immediate requirements .
 In Super Performance mode CPU, Z shows the bus speed to increase up to 169 .
One word of advice is to be really careful about which anti, malware software you install since it will degrade performance both on and off the internet on these netbooks .
 Whatever you elect to install I would highly recommend you benchmark the performance both before and after .
 I expect to get 6, 7 hours in high performance mode .
 faster overall performance, and shorter charge life on the battery .
 Asus' center of excellance is in very reliable, very stable, high performance circuitry, mainly motherboards .
 I have the Super Hybrid Engine set to auto mode, which I'm guessing is less than High or Super Performance   .
 Comes with unusually well, written documentation, though I'm still a little fuzzy on the different power, saving performance modes :
 Overall though, I am happy with the performance .
4 PASS ,  Battery life is amazing, used the laptop in  Super Performance Mode  for over 6 hours of watching videos, checking email, connecting with USB Verizon broadband card, and still had battery life leftover .
As for the performance of this little computer, I've gotta tell ya :
 The performance is great for it's size ,  remember these are not designed to be speed demons but to be highly portable and cordless for extended periods of time .
 Just some advice ,  use Eset's anti, virus and not Norton, McAfee, CA or the like ,  if not you will loose a lot in performance .
 Upgrade to 2gb of memory, but did not seem to make much different in performance in either xp or windows 7 .
 I find that the performance is great for my use on just 1GB that comes with it .
 I keep a couple of apps running and its performance is great .
Amazon seems to be concerned that I am simply  experiencing performance or compatibility problems , , and that my computer thus does not qualify as  defective  by their criteria, , but I would contend that a new computer that cannot be supplied with electricity is a complete lemon .
 The reviews on many of the higher resolutions netbooks also stated poor video and processing performance .
 I haven't hit my swap yet in several weeks of heavy use, and performance has been more than satisfactory for what I do with it .
 Replacing them isn't very hard given a screw and five minutes, and doing so noticeably ups the performance .
 Otherwise its performance has been bug, free and met all expectations .
 It enhances performance, but is not absolutely necessary because this unit is a full featured machine .
The Wireless performance is great .
0 out of 5 stars Excellent balance of performance and value, October 23, 2009
I am very satisfied with the performance of the Atom processor .
 This did not affect me much, I can write without problems full university texts, media files run without any problem   and the battery have been used for seven consecutive hours using the computer to the maximum in High Performance Mode without depleted .
The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   .
 The only area that I've seen, so far, where the performance is not adequate, is with some streaming videos, but that's not important to me .
0 out of 5 stars Excellant Portability and Performance, August 14, 2009
I'm actually downgrading in performance in getting this netbook but the performance lost is made up with the smaller form factor and greatly increased battery life .
 I then loaded Windows 7 RC and the performance has been great .
 After upgrading to 2Gb of memory   and deleting useless pre, installed software, performance has not been an issues .
 I have the following software installed and they work great, modest but tolerable performance reduction :
 No noticeable performance reduction
 Performance reduction here is much less than superpi would suggest .
My desktop is a very strong dual, core computer running windows 7 and I cant see a performance decrease doing everyday things on the netbook .
 1 light weight, 2 long battery life, and 3 reasonable performance .
 Performance is good, screen very good, wireless very good, numerous USB ports, and keyboard layout is excellent .
 Battery performance couldn't be more nice, as well as performance .
Been very pleased with performance and battery life, however power supply went out after 60 days .
The performance is fantastic ,  opening a browser, establishing wireless connection, opening PDF documents, opening powerpoint files and word documents is comparable to my newest desktop PC .
 I had thought the RAM was too small for good performance but I was wrong .
 I spent a bit of time researching the various netbooks currently available and thought that the 1005HA, P had a nice mix of style, battery life, ergonomics, and performance   .
 The performance and speed of this laptop is amazing .
I was aprehensive about its capabilities while buying it but after using it for 15 odd days, i am very satisfied with its performance .
 I use this setting but it shouldn't be used for movies as it inhibits performance during playback .
 There's only 1 GB of RAM, and that's good enough for me since I'll only be running low, performance applications   .
 It freaked me out since I wasn't running anything high performance .
0 out of 5 stars Good ergonomics, exceptional battery, performance meets expectations .
 Very acceptable performance for what netbooks are designed to do .
