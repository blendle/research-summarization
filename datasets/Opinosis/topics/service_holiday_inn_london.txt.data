not customer, oriented hotelvery low service levelboor reception
The room was quiet, clean, the bed and pillows were comfortable, and the service was adequate .
 There were no service issues to speak of, but it's not an overly, friendly hotel .
Good Location Horrible Service Disgusting Procedures .
If you're looking for a full, service experience, this is still not the hotel for you .
The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum is fine if you like large, impersonal hotels with mediocre service, overcrowded breakfast rooms and don't mind tired decor .
We found the front desk service unfriendly and indifferent .
Great stay friendly service great location .
 A prompt reply indicated not and that the reception area deposit boxes were temporarily out of service, so they offered to upgrade our rooms to executive rooms at no extra cost .
In London its often hard to find good location and good customer service in the same place ,  The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum did that for me and I couldn't ask for more .
 Breakfast was good, with many choices and excellent service .
 Service in all areas, at all levels was good .
 It's rated 4, stars, but I also stayed at an equivalently rated Marriott while in London, and a 3, star Holiday Inn Express in Scotland, and the service and rooms were much better at the other locations .
 Maid service was good and the staff were always pleasant .
 At the reception the service were exelent ,  altought during that five minutes I was standing there, the receptionists appologised three times !
Good Location New Room Bad Service  .
 The only cleanliness complaint is the cleaning service did not remove dirty glasses or a decaying lemon wedge with the in room kettle service .
 I am recommending the Forum despite the service problems .
Poor serviceNot friendly assistance .
 It is not 4 star hotel service .
Convenient location not 4, star room and services but OK .
ROOM and SERVICE ,  our room was obviously not one of the renovated ones .
Service was a joke , ,  the  evening concierge  doubled as the day doorman and was not very knowledgeable about anything , ,  honestly, the last thing I want to hear when I ask about cool pubs to go to is  why don't you go to the bar in the hotel ?
 Service impersonal but friendly .
 Did not use any of the hotels other services, but I was pleased overall and would stay here again .
 They also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .
 We arrived at 11 am, but were able to check in with the professional and service, minded staff right away .
 Someone needs to help those folks with a refresher course in customer service .
 Near a tube station that services three subway lines, for starters .
We are low maintenance so we didn't have to request service much, but when we did it was fine .
Not too happy with the service from frontdesk, concierge and housekeeping .
 I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .
 If you need a hotel with services like access to a computer or a concierge who can do more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .
 However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service   .
 For a little extra money, the soon to be Crowne Plaza over the road offers far better service yet with the same great location
 Only postive is their breakfast service .
Convenient location Great Concierge service .
 I would definitely stay here again for the location and the great customer service .
 Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .
 The service was the worst service we have EVER recieved in my life the worst .
30am, service finished at 11am, there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring ,  the ingredients seemed poor quality .
Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a £6 .
, but after I called room service it was promptly fixed .
There are no bottle openers or cork screws in the room so ask room service for them if you need them .
 There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it .
 Reception was busy but service was good throughout my stay .
 But there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff .
 The room and bathroom were very clean and serviced each day to a high standard .
 The main restaurant is on floor 1 and offers a full cooked and continental buffet was good choice and generally very good service .
If you're looking for a comfortable, clean hotel with a mid, range level of service and easy access, then this hotel would serve you well .
 We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .
 Did not use any other facilities or order room service .
 There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .
Exceptionally poor ,  and surprising ,  service .
Great location service questionable .
 Our room was clean, though small, the service was great, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat !
I liked this hotel, Nice big room and very good customer service .
 Front, line staff members speak very poor English, and provide VERY poor customer service   .
 Poor customer service, bad and overpriced pub food .
 Room service took 15 minutes, which shocked me .
 We were very pleased with the room, and the staff was all very nice and helpful, including the concierge service .
 If you hang around in the lobby, you can hear other people complaining about poor service, poor room quality and a host of other problems to the staff .
but be prepared for some poor service quality .
 Service can be slow at peak times with waits up to one hour at times, but on average I had to wait no longer that around 30 minutes .
 The food was excellent, the service was very friendly and the prices cheap .
 The food is excellent and the service great .
Service was friendly, our room was on the highest floor  , but that wasn't a problem because of the lifts, and we had a great view of the city from the room .
 but after having spent an entire week in London, I came to realize that just about anybody in the service industry is just that .
 Service was impeccably English hotel, wide .
 The breakfast is self service on the first floor, not cheap   but not bad either as there is plenty of choice .
 The card which is left for you to leave comments and review your service went missing from my room on the fourth day which speaks volumes .
 The service is pleasant enough, and I was given a room with a nice view of central London   on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .
 This is suppose to be a full service hotle, but I would only classify it at best as a Motel 6 quality .
 Service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .
 The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .
 On the first night of my stay, I tried to use room service .
 On the third night I tried room service again .
 Room service pesonnel called me up after about 45minutes asking if I really needed the stuff that I had ordered .
the atmosphere is such that they are always right and that a customer is doing them a service by staying at the hotel .
 Is this the level of customer service you want ?
On my last day I used the concierge service to arrange a cab for me .
If you use wake up call service .
 I think that is bad service .
 There is a shuttle service for 34 pounds which needs to be booked one day ahead and plys only every half hour .
Great location indifferent service .
I would stay here again because in London it really is a value for the service and quality of room .
 Despite its size, and the fact that there are over 20 floors of bedrooms, lift service was never slow, and the breakfast operation   is exceptionally well, managed .
 The maid service was good and everything was cleaned and tidied .
 We ate at a really good Indian, very popular, good service plenty to eat for about £7 each .
Basic clean lodging service lacking .
   The internet service which costs GBP15 per day is slower than dial, up  !
Good room poor service all round .
But those who put an emphasis on service quality should avoid this hotel .
 The rude and poor service started from the concierge who was curt when I asked a question .
 The service at the breakfast room was ok .
 The only down side was the same as last time, very impersonal service by the Management and the on, duty Manager was just pure rude, but if you don't have to talk to any staff members, this hotel is great .
Stayed in room 516 right at the end of the corridor was next to a services room from which there was a constant generator   fan noise .
 We passed a number of banks on the way up and also a large post office offering currency etc which should give better rates than the hotels in, house money changing service .
 There is 24 hour room service, a restaurant, and a tavern in the hotel although we did not sample the hotel food .
 In all, as with many Holiday Inns hotels worldwide, affordable with good rooms and customer service but there is always one or two issues that keep this chain from being a affordable and good place to stay .
 The fridge was self, service   and barely functional, so didn't chill the sodas I bought .
 The immediate area around the hotel is extremely well serviced by at least 3 internet cafes, grocery store next to tube station, as well as several nice cafes and restaurants .
 ASK is a very nice Italian restaurant nearby serving pastas and pizzas with excellent service which will run about 10
 If you are looking for a bit more comfort and better service, look elsewhere .
 Although we did get a strange phone call from room service at 1am, wrong number i think .
Well, located and good service .
 In spite of its size, we found the service to be good ,  speedy check, in, and very rapid response to a broken toilet at 11pm .
 Minimall with Boots pharmacy, Whole Foods type ritzy fullservice market, coffee shops, etc .
 The hotel offers a laundry service which I needed to take advantage of .
 However the service was quite efficient  my pants were brought back the same day .
 It was clean and serviced promptly every day with fresh linen and towels .
com and their 'top secret hotels' service .
 Service was great and the concierge was very helpful .
Excellent location shame about the service !
When we wanted to watch a pay per view movie, was informed by reception there was a problem ,  it later transpired that we had been given an Aircrew room, where there is no mini, bar, pay per view movies turned off at reception, no menu's or room service available .
 Also we were later informed that only executive rooms had the service of mini bar !
 The maid service was excellent and we felt very happy with our choice .
We took a private car service from airport to hotel, and it cost 55 pounds .
Don't use the restaurant or room service, there's plenty of places to eat outside the hotel, there's a mini Tesco for groceries, a larger grocery store   plenty of internet cafe's, a Paul's Boulangerie right by the tube, great fro a quick breakfast, the Gloucester Road tube stop is a 3 minute walk, plenty of busses to High Street fabulous shopping !
 My daugher and I average about $70 a dinner regardless of whehter we ate out or did room service ,  ,  YIKES .
 Service is not particularly attentive, but not rude .
 Stunning food, amazing service .
Great service and perfect location !
 For the price, cleanliness, service and quality it definately deserves a higher star rating .
I wish that the hotel had better service, however .
 To get ice, you have to first get a bucket from room service .
 To get Room Service, it called Housekeeping .
For a similarly good location  , you can stay at the London Hilton Metropole for the same price and receive much better service .
 Quite snooty or surly service at reception, from two separate people .
Staff were mostly ethnic origin, presenting a couple of communication problems at check in   room service was slow and fairly bland   and we noticed a lack of acknowledgement by any staff as we walked around the premises, again unusual for such a high profile company .
 I stayed in room 354 ,  on the Exec Floor ,  no bathrobes, no newspaper delivery  , room service crockery standing outside room for almost 24 hours un movedand poor service in Bistro .
 We had room service the night we arrived, and it was good quality, and arrived quickly .
 Super dinner and attentive service .
 Food was OK, service very haphazard .
 It is very close to Gloucester Rd tube station, has plenty of restaurants, pubs, supermarkets, chemists within 100 yds, is close to Hyde park for a run walk in summer, near Kensington High street, rooms are always clean and have recently been refurbed, room service menu is better than other hotel chains, breakfast is good .
We had one evening meal in the ground floor restaurant, well cooked again, but the service was very slow .
 Finally, the hotel did nothing to inform us about a transit strike on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50 pounds plus banking holiday surcharge, , we luckily found a cheaper alternative by ourselves .
 The included breakfeast was a plus and I noticed the wifi folks using the free service in the lobby .
 I noticed on my last stay that the quality of service was very diminished .
 We were on the 20th floor   very happy with the rooms   the service .
 I can say that every time I have been disappointed with either the value, standards, cleanliness,service of the hotel .
 The food was good and the service was very good .
Excellent location and service .
 Concierge was very helpful  we didnt take the English breakfast but the downstairs bar offers croissants and Starbucks coffee and the service was very nice .
 Service was efficient but far from personal, how could it be when the place was as a large as it was !
 It met all my expectations ,  very clean room w pleasing modern decor, above average housekeeping services, accomodating staff .
Additionally, one other problem was that room service was very very inefficient ,  requesting a menu to be brought to the room took 45 minutes and the guy actually had the audacity to suggest he read it to me over the phone instead of sending one up, after I had to call three times .
 Room service will bring a bucket of ice any time, or theres a machine on the 25th floor .
 Typical London impersonal service from staff .
Excellent location service cleanliness and price at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum .
 All in all great location ,  nice restaurants nearby, nicely pitched service .
What brings down my rating for the hotel is their service .
 I still can't figure out if it's a difference in  service  from US and UK standards or if it's just this hotel .
 Good concierge service ,  recommended very good restaurants ,  italian and indian ,  to us ,  in walking distance from the hotel .
 The hotel staff are very helpful and provided excellent service .
 We used room service one night and it was excellent .
 Food quality was good, service prompt, everything prepared as we had ordered .
 The service was great with lots of coffee and tea and toast brought to the table for you .
 The price is moderate for the service and the location .
 The price, the space, the location and the service were the exactly right thing we wanted .
This hotel is located in an excellent area of London and is just around the corner from Gloucester St tube station which has excellent service to all the tourist sites .
 Fantastic, professional, helpful staff, clean rooms, great room service, fitness area and Internet Business facilities keep me coming back .
 Great location, freshly renovated, very small rooms, anonymous hotel, acceptable service .
 because it has sensor to count how many times you open it for beverage service, nice area, near Starbucks, pastry shops, fast foods, supermarket, walking distances to Kensington Palace, London Natural Science Museum, Harrods, Victoria Albert Musuem, pubs, and what else could you ask for .
 My family stayed in 2 connecting rooms this July and had outstanding customer service .
, We booked our room through an internet service and was lodged in an executive room that included all the aminities expected in a 5, star hotel !
 We also love the service of the staff, not to foreget the kindly people which store our bags .
I was very disappointed with the service from this huge hotel .
 Service was great and the location of the hotel was very convenient   .
 Be cautious of using the room services like the phone, mini bar and room service as the prices are sky high, but I would definitely stay there again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone !
