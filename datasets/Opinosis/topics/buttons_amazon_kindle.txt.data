I thought it would be fitting to christen my Kindle with the Stephen King novella UR, so went to the Amazon site on my computer and clicked on the button to buy it .
 As soon as I'd clicked the button to confirm my order it appeared on my Kindle almost immediately !
After reading through the introductory guide that loads up automatically at the start and following along it took me almost no time to learn which buttons are where and what each of them do .
 I started reading with the default size without my glasses and noticed I was squinting a bit, so changed to one size larger with a couple button clicks and it was much easier without feeling like the print was too big and took up too much of the page .
 The gadget feeling is underlined by needing to press a button to turn pages .
It took very little time to get used to having to push a button to turn pages and the screen flash as they turn only really startled me the first few times .
 I don't feel the need to push the button ahead of time to prepare for the end of the page at all, which evidently a lot of Kindle 1 owners do since it's a bit more sluggish .
 unintended page changes, the awkward way I sometimes have to hold it to keep from hitting buttons, the sometimes slow page refresh, and the screen freezes that now has me traveling with a paper clip lest I need to do a reset while commuting on the train .
 No longer do I have to press and hold two buttons to put the device to sleep .
 the button hinges are on the outside ,  at the edge ,  of the K2 .
 You need to press on the interior of the button to get it to click .
 Combine that with the smaller button sizes and one major source of frustration has been instantly eliminated !
 The little power button at the top of the Kindle is really a power slide .
 The change in the hinging and size of the buttons is major plus and would make it hard to go back to the K1 .
 sleeker look and feel  , sharper screen, no longer accidentally depressing the next page button by accident and having to find your place in the book again .
,  The 5, way button, though a bit small, allows you to select left and right, and not just up and down like the original version .
 Only issue is I need to recalibrate now, , in general, I try to anticipate how much time it will take the next page to load, and when I'm two lines from the bottom, I would hit the next page button .
 Now I need to push the button later .
 That 5, way button is magical .
The main issue I had with Kindle 1 was the navigation button design and placement .
 I like to read holding the Kindle with one hand and it just didn't work well because I kept bumping the next, previous and back buttons .
 The display is better and the 5, way button is a major improvement .
 On off buttons are repositioned to be easily accessible .
 Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .
 The second thing is the buttons .
 This means that when you handle the Kindle 2 by the edges, the pages don't change even if you grab by the buttons .
 Yet changing pages is effortless when you do ,  the buttons are right between your thumbs and the slightest pressure on their faces is enough to activate them .
 That it doesn't have the quirky, clunky, annoying buttons that filled ¾ of each side of its predecessor, buttons that caused dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier .
What I like most about the Kindle 2 is the placement of the buttons and their inversion .
 It has the feel of the mouse button in the middle of a laptop keyboard and I never liked those .
 Manipulating that button reminded me of something I'd rather not think about when trying to get work done .
 if you don't upgrade, you will regret it every time you accidentally hit one of the obscenely large buttons and advance or retreat one, two, three, or even four pages .
 The page turn buttons are better .
 With the Kindle 1, I was constantly at risk of accidentally bumping the next page buttons .
 With the Kindle 2, the buttons have been scaled down to a much more manageable size and are a lot less sensitive .
 I love the 4, way directional button .
 It took a little getting used to after having used the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .
 It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good buttons, which are easy to operate on purpose but not so easy accidentally .
 A button click brings up the dictionary, starting with that entry .
It's very easy to page forward or backward through the text with the dedicated buttons .
 The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .
 The buttons are not hard to press at all .
 Every K2 button has a satisfying 
 Just like how I prefer to grasp the page a few sentences before the end of a page, I tend to press the  Next Page  button a bit sooner than I finish reading the page .
 The lag actually helps in that respect, and even so, the lag between pushing the button and the new page appearing is much faster than I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine .
,  Inside, edge buttons ,  These have saved me from accidentally pressing buttons many times .
 The text is darker and clearer and the buttons are more like the Sony , ,  both on one side   .
 when I received my Kindle 2 I was very impressed with the design, especially the improved button design .
Tiny buttons with even tinier text on the buttons .
The incredibly tiny buttons are literally impossible for people with low, vision to read .
 And the tiny buttons with the even tinier text ?
Greatly improved page turning buttons .
 The codes vary depending on which button I press and the most recent code has been 90UGC .
Each time this has happened, I have contacted the support team, each time the team member has made me delete the book from the device,they've resent it to me and I've had to do the hold the power button for 20 seconds process each time .
I'm not crazy about the way that the scroll button works either .
 The buttons and the controller work smoothly .
 Sleek style, easy to hold, the white causes it to disappear as suggested in its description, highly transportable, well thought out button placement, easy to use, adjustable font, ease of downloading new books .
 I love how the content manager is better integrated and I don't have to hit so many buttons to manage my books .
What I hate ,  I hate the new button positioning .
 Since the K2 is longer and the buttons are near the bottom, its awkward to hold and feels unbalanced in my hands, almost like it will tip over .
 When I'm trying to go to the next page, I hit the home button by accident a lot .
 I also hate the fact that you really have to push the buttons hard to change the page .
 I really liked the extra responsiveness of the K1 buttons   .
 However I was disappointed to discover that I was unable to press the buttons from that position .
 With the K2 I can turn on the TTS feature with one button, place it beside me, and have it read to me all night !
I contemplated changes to my beloved Kindle with dread, I was one of the few who loved the old page, turning buttons .
 I worried that the new buttons would be Sony Reader size, and impossible for me to press .
 Thankfully the buttons are still at least thumb, size, and may appear hard to press, until you realize that they are hinged on the inside .
 I like the new size and feel of the buttons .
 It is much harder now to accidentally hit the page buttons .
 But holding the darn thing was a chore without pressing that next button page .
 Kind of hard to do when you're inadvertently pressing buttons .
 Also the keyboard has been redesigned to make things easier as well as added buttons like  menu  which is nice .
 I find myself using a large size typeface to compensate for the lack of contrast, but this means frequent  next page  button presses which is extremely annoying .
 The buttons have a cheap feel .
 The  next page  buttons should activate when pressed at any angle .
 Upgrade the quality of the hardware especially the buttons .
 You can pretty much figure everything out by just trying the buttons .
The next, previous, back buttons are much smaller and are hard to hit accidentally .
The keyboard buttons are small, round, low, profile and have slightly convex tops .
The on, off button is now on top and the radio on, off switch is now in a software menu .
The Kindle 1 roller button and quirky silver navigation bar are gone .
 My thanks to  Arts&HistoryFan  for pointing out that when you hit the menu button, the time is shown in the top banner .
 Yes, I noticed some of the initial design flaws in the first, generation Kindle ,  the placement of the  next page  buttons, the general sense of flimsiness ,  but I decided I could live with those .
 Opened the box, press the button and it begins downloading books that I pre, ordered .
 The welcome screen comes on to explain all the buttons .
 One thing I didn't like was the page next button failed to work when the text to speech was in use and I wanted to skip ahead .
 sym button depressed at same time
 Buttons are accessible, raised for convenience of all involved ,  another big plus for the visually impaired or those with other conditions .
 The sound button is raised only slightly ,  fine for VI but potentially problematic for those with arthritis or other issues with fine motor function as it is a relatively thin button that must be pressed slightly .
The buttons are well placed and need a good push to change pages, but not so much that it detracts from your reading .
Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .
 I miss having a dedicated button to deactivate the wireess, but the overall device has improved so much that I will get over the loss quickly .
Buttons are not hard to press for me .
 They do require a bit of pressure, but I like it that way so I can rest my thumbs on the buttons without turning the page accidentally .
 They seem to be in the perfect location, I can grip the K2 easily and do not have to worry about pressing a button on accident but when I need to change the page they are right where I want them .
 Moving the cursor to the word in question can be a bit awkward since there is some delay using the 5 direction button, but it's not so awkward as to not use the feature .
 Getting a free sample wirelessly and then just hitting a button to buy it is great .
 I hate tiny gadgets with tiny screens covered with tiny buttons that lead to a labyrinth of tiny submenus filled with nonsensical options .
 Click a button and it's there in seconds .
 The buttons have been made smaller, which fixed the large buttons on the lst generation that made the device hard to hold and frustratingly easy to advance the page .
,  One button to turn on, turn off, and sleep .
 I also like the fact the button is on the top and not on the back as it was on the K1 .
 I just have to use the new five way button to highlight the word and look up shows at the bottom without leaving the page .
significant improvement over Kindle 1's non intuitive forward and previous buttons .
 Also I'm afraid that overusing the mouse button may cause it to wear out quickly .
 If you wish to go back say a dozen pages to look up something you simply have to press the 'previous page' button 12 times in succession .
 Again navigation is by using the next and previous page buttons .
 My mother, in, law has enough difficulty with her fingers and the tiny buttons that she generally uses a pencil, eraser to push the buttons .
 When you look at it, if you don't focus too hard, the little buttons and controls fade away and all you see is the text .
 The only thing you can do is rotate, which makes some PDFs readable but then you're in the awkward position of having to press the next and previous page buttons vertically instead of horizontally .
 One day while laying on the couch reading I pressed the 'next page' button and the screen went blank .
 While not as much text fits on a screen as on a mass, market paperback page using the font size I like, pushing the  next page  button has become second nature .
 My one complaint is that I'd like a  previous page  button on both side of the screen, the way there's a  next page  button on both sides, but that's a very minor consideration .
 Reading the book in the cover isn't a problem as the front cover readily folds around to the back so that it isn't making the left, edge buttons hard to press .
 To use the  enter  function, that is to execute a command or enter the text I've typed in, I just have to push downward on the square button .

 The buttons really are much better .

 The buttons are also laid out and I'm so glad they put the  Next  buttons on both sides since it makes it so easy to use .
 The Qwerty keyboard, while the buttons are small, is spaced nicely for ease of use .
 I find the Kindle buttons perfect for this type of device .
I find the buttons easy to use .
,  I find the myriad of buttons on the face of the device to be very nicely done .
 As highly documented before, the buttons on the side of the device used for page turning, going to the home screen, and accessing the menu all engage with an inward click .
 This enables you to pick up the device with the edges without pressing any buttons .
 They buttons are well placed .
 The page turning buttons are a lot easier to hit than say, flipping a page in a real book while lying in bed, having said page get caught up on the covers, and having to adjust to get it squared away .
 The major buttons on both sides are for the next page .
 For some reason, my brain wants a prior page button on the left side and the next page button on the right .
 I hit the page button once and looked left as though I had turned an actual page in a book .
A minor grumble, I keep wanting to press Next Page rather than the select button to make things happen .
 Its the position of the buttons that seems to make me want to do that .
 I intuitively want the biggest button to be 'select' rather than Next Page .

 When you hold it in the opposite hand, the next page button is on the other side too .
 I don't need two hands to hold the book open when I'm on the train, or whenever, just one hand gives you good access to all the buttons even while you are holding the device .
 I also love the fact they made the next and previous page buttons a little bit harder to push so I am not constantly pressing buttons I don't mean to .
 The buttons work well even with my large fingers and the navigating 5, position control is easily mastered and easy to use effectively .
, new buttons are a massive step up .
 You can hold the buttons on the edge and not turn pages .
 There is a feeling of strength to the thumb buttons, they are not oversensitive like the old ones, and the keyboard is a great improvement over those odd keys on the K1 .

 The buttons are placed in a convenient area without being in the way, yet turning a page is a breeze .
 Previous button presses inward, toward the screen, while other buttons press toward the outside edges .
 All of the controls and buttons are well placed and easy to understand .
The redesign of the buttons is a great improvement .
When I purchased the Kindle originally, I had several issues with the physical layout, the inability to stop the  accidental  button pushing and the sharp corners .
In the Kindle 2, the corners have been rounded and the buttons have been restructured so that it takes a little pressure to press inward instead of outward .
The placement of the on off button is much better at the top rather than the back as previously .
 I really enjoy the menu button and the 5, way controller to navigate .
 The buttons rubbed the fingers at the bottom .
 On the Kindle 2, the button has been moved to the top right side of the device .
The keyboard buttons are smaller and also require some pressure to activate .
 What remains to be seen, however, is whether the Kindle 2 will be plagued with having to be reset as frequently as the Kindle, nor did I see a reset button .

 The buttons on the K2 are not easily pressed while reading, and I love the 5, way button that allows me to easily navigate between my newpaper pages   .
