 It's fast to acquire satellites .
 If you've ever had a  Brand X  GPS take you on some strange route that adds 20 minutes to your trip, has you turn the wrong way down a one way road, tell you to turn AFTER you've passed the street, frequently loses the satellite signal, or has old maps missing streets, you know how important this stuff is .
 The Garmin Nuvi 255W connects to satellites extremely fast, , So when I get in my car and turn it on, we're pretty much ready to go immediately .
It picks up the satellites quickly  , routes fast, has good animation maybe 6, 8 frames a second ?
 The revised chipset allows the GPS to make satellite connections quickly .
 The unit takes very quickly locks on to satellite signals, tracks very well and when you miss a turn or do something unexpected, recalculates a new route very quickly .
 Hotfix   to lock on to satellite signals works well .
 On I, 76 in PA, I travelled through a mile long tunnel and it tracked me perfectly even though it obviously could not get satellite signals inside the tunnel .
 Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable .
 I would say that 90% of the time it acquires a satellite within the first 2 minutes or less, the other 10% is due to the above events .
And it is very fast locating satellites, the new interface needs some time to get used to, it is very cool now you can drag the map with your fingers !
 It is quick in picking up satellite signals and very responsive with the user interface   .
Satellite lock, up and navigation precision was better for TomTom, e .
 I guess it was because during the traffic jams we encountered I guess it loss contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .
 Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates that problem .
by the time the main menu comes up after turning the device on it generally already has a full 100% signal from the satellites and it's ready to navigate, a beautiful crystal clear LCD widescreen, and tons of other features .
 Satellite acquisition time is very fast, as is re, routing .
 It also has a  hot fix  which finds satellites faster ,  which is very useful for starting your trip immediately and great for recalculating routes very quickly .
 SATELLITE RECEPTION, , Being in downtown Charlotte with skyscrapers surrounding me, the Nuvi maintained reception everywhere except a parking garage   .
 On a major highway leading into downtown it lost all satellite coverage and told me to make a U, turn on the 6 lane highway !
 If the  hot fix  satellite performance is supposed to be fast, I'd hate to see the older versions without it .
 I'd be at my destination before they located the satellites .
 It has no problems locating the satellites and does not get lost .
Improved super fast satellite acquisition
 I tested it again on a road trip and constantly lost satellite reception .
 When I first turned the unit on, it had to search for satellites and pinpoint my location .
 After turning the unit off and back on again, the GPS unit must search for satellites and  re, locate  me .
Time to search for satellites :
 The time that it takes to acqure the Satellites is about 10, 30 seconds .
It lost satellite contact a couple of times on the trip   but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .
 The device beeps when satellite connection is lost but I never noticed any indication of when the connection came back .
 When you turn on the unit, initial satellite connection takes about 3 minutes .
I really love the new interface, the turn signs at the corner, speed limit indicator and the fast satellite reception .
 The refreshing rate is fast and locks on to the satellites almost instantly .
 It doesn't take long to locate satellites, maybe 15 seconds or so .
 Good routing  , easy to use, quick to lock on to satellites .
 But unlike my previous Garmin, the satellite acquisition is very fast, and recalculation when I deviate from the stated route is almost immediate .
 Bottom line is I wanted a unit that is accurate and had reliable satellite connection .
I was able to connect to a satellite within about five minutes of taking the unit out of the box .
 I have noticed no problems with this unit's ability to detect satellites .
It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .
When powered up initially it does a one, time search for satellites .
 I took the unit outside to do that, and it found the satellites very quickly .
 In the car, it locks onto the satellites extremely fast .
 It is much faster to find the satellite signals than my friend's TomTom 910 .
255W always acquires satellite signal quickly
 Didn't even have time to really read up on the gadget so there may be features I don't know about, but just have to link it up to the satellites and off you go .
 Many places in Northern Montana and especially Utah lost contact with satellite info .
The satellite fix is very fast, about twice as fast as my old one .
 large screen, text to speech street names, quick satellite fixes, and more, I think I made the best choice for my money .
 So far, what I like the most is how fast it acquires the satellites .
 Picked up satellites very quickly .
 Even when my pickup is in the garage overnight with no power to the unit when I back out the next day it has the satellites instantly .
 The 255W finds satellites faster than any other GPS on the market .
 It includes the new Hot Fit technology and remembers the satellites positions when you turn the GPS off, so the next time you turn it on, it can relocate them very fast .
 It also finds the satellite quickly .
 I plugged this into my van's lighter socket turned it on and it found the satellites in about 5 seconds while inside my garage .
 The recalculate time is excellent, so is the satellite signal connection .
 Took a few minutes for the unit to link up with the satellite, but once that was done, it was a breeze .
 Also, as a novice user, I am really surprised at the time it takes for it to capture satellite signals, holding it up to the sky, outdoors .
 My only complaints so far is that the gps loses satellite reception often and confuses itself .
 It's fast in aquiring satellites and fast in entering addresses with a minimum of keystrokes .
 It grabs satellites quickly and recalculates routes in seconds after I veer off in the wrong direction .
