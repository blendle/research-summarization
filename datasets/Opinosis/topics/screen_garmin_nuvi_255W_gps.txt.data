  It is easy to read and when touching the screen it works great !
 and zoom out   buttons on the 255w to the same side of the screen which makes it a bit easier .
 On the 750 the zoom buttons are on opposite sides of the screen .
 The screen is easily readable in the sun, and I love how it automatically dims to 20% at night .
 Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .
The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .
The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .
 The screen is very bright and easy to see with direct sunlight and at night time .
 If you are looking for a simple wide screen GPS the Nuvi 255W is the right choice .
One of my favorite features on the Garmin 255W is the odometer screen that will allow you to track all sorts of data about your long car trip .
 It tells you on the main screen your estimated time of arrival which will change depending upon your stops and speed .
 Additionally, I find the data in the odometer screen to be fasscinating .
Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .
,  255w has an arrow at the top of the screen that shows the direction of the next turn .
 To make things worse, in the the  Main st  may not be on the screen on the default scale .
 The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .
 Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .
The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .
 On the other hand, after about a week of using the Garmin, it seems to understand where we are, and now POIs as far as 25 miles away will show up when the screen is touched .
 The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .
I switched to the Nuvi 255W after the screen on my Nuvi 760 got cracked .
> Same screen size as the other 4 .
> Better screen touch sensitivity
> More responsive that my old 760  , plus a better looking screen
 The home screen shows four options :
 Any time you are viewing the map, you can zoom in or out by tapping the appropriate icon located on the top right of the screen .
 I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .
 If you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the screen for written directions .
 So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .
 The screen is bright and the maps are generally good .
3 Love the touch screen technology
There were a few times I drove under overpasses on the interstate and no intersection was shown on the screen .
Typical of Garmin, the product works well, wide screen is very nice .
 Functionally the only slight problem is that on my unit I have to press pretty hard on the screen if I want to 'drag' the map .
 The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .
 Now the only screen I get says the system software is missing .
 I use the suction cup mount because I like to keep the screen in my frame of vision without turning my head, but I make sure to take it with me when I park my car .
 From the map screen it's but 2 presses on the large and accessible touchscreen to get a  Where Am I ?
 I also realize that even if I crashed differently I had been injured in other ways but the car were still drivable that it's but 1 press on the screen to get direction to the nearest emergency services   from that lovely screen that told me where I was .
I just wish the screen is larger .
1 Wanted a wide screen model, its difficult to see the 4 
4 It has built in picture viewer and a card slot, so insert your memory card, browse to picture browser and you don't need a PC, has enough big screen to enjoy
 Its for wide screen models and it fits perfectly my 255w with a flap that covers it screen .
 I chose a hard type of case that zippered the screen in, as I didn't want the possibility of it sliding out .
 Also, it's hard to view the screen when it's super sunny outside, but the text to speech capability is an advantage .
Before I get into the specifics of my review, let me offer one important piece of advice , ,  BUY A CARRYING CASE to protect the screen !
 These gadgets have sensitive touchscreen menus, and I think the fact that I didn't protect the screen on my last GPS is the reason it died after only 14 months .
 I had a Nuvi 205 and I really liked it but I wanted a bigger screen .
  It's an emergency location feature ,  you can tap the screen to get your latitude and longitude .
 BUT, in direct sunlight, the screen is difficult to see in my convertible .
Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .
The local  speed limit  is shown on left side of the screen with current driving speed shown at the bottom of the screen .
 One thing that would be useful is putting a mute button on the screen available at all times .
 Having the speed limit show up on the screen was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .
 I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !
 I was afraid the screen on one of these things would be too small for me to see, and the last thing I need would be futzing around with a GPS screen when I'm on the road if I wanted to do that, I could drive and read a map !
 The screen is huge next to some of the units I saw .
 I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .
 It has a very clear and bright screen and is loaded with multiple useful features .
 It has a great screen presentation that is very easy to read when it is mounted on your windshield .
3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .
 The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .
 The screen is large so that it is easily read while you're driving .
 The wide screen and spoken street names are a must .
 If I'm listening to loud music, I won't be able to hear the exact words but I can hear it vaguely and that is a cue that I should glance down at the top of the screen and see what my next move is .
 There should be an external volume control on the unit, or at least volume control from the main map screen .
 The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .
 Also, push every icon on every screen you see .
 In both instances this could have been avoided if I had just paid attention to the screen which showed the correct road highlighted .
 The dashboard mount keeps the unit easily within reach so that you can safely touch the screen while driving .
 Was thinking about buying the 265WT for only $45 more, but decided I didn't need bluetooth or the Traffic Feature which gives you flash advertisements on the screen .
 Those are the only 2 differences between the 2 models and I'd rather not have flash advertisements coming up on my GPS screen at random .
3 Inch screen is awesome to look at both during the day and at night .
 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .
The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .
 The screen is big enough to view maps, street names, etc easily .
Sufficiently sensitive touch screen
 Now if Garmin would put a compass on the main screen always pointing to the north, it would be perfect .
 We love the spoken street names and the wide screen .
 The 255w does not have a convenient volume control  you must go through the menu system on the screen .
 The screen size makes it really easy to see without being a safety hazard .
The background of the screen turns black when it's nighttime .
 The user must get into a few layers of the menu to access the touch screen volume control .
 Screen is clear and maps are pretty easy to follow .
 I look at the direction line at the top bar of the screen to make sure I understand what the verbal instructions were .
3 inches large screen is large enough for you to see the details of the map yet not distracting you from driving .
3 inches screen and steady performance .
,  Its a touch screen and a 4 .
3 wide screen also   speak out the streets name and tells you when or how far to turn
,  Also very quick and I mean quick reroute when you miss a turn plus smooth update position when moving, not choppy on the screen .
,  EASY to read day or night you can also adjust the screen brightness
 One down side is the lack of volume button on the unit you have to adjust the volume form the tool menu on the screen which can be a challenge if you want to change the volume when you are driving .
After lots of internet research, we settled on the Garmin 255W for the text, to, speech and wide screen features .
 When attached to the PC, the screen just indicates the connection .
 The wide screen is important because of the better keyboard   .
 We started with a non, touch screen which was great, then we updated to the streetpilot C330 which was a dream .
 After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .
Looking at comparable units, this one seems to have more features and a larger screen .
 I can even see the screen without my reading glasses .
It speaks the street names if you touch the car on the screen it lets you know lat and long .
 Screen size is good and I didn't want one that had blue tooth and a lot of 'extras' I wouldn't use .
 With either unit, the text on the screen usually tells you what you need to know .
 I've only used the wide screen versions, so I can't compare, but I personally wouldn't want to go to a smaller screen .
The Garmin nuvi 255W I bought through Amazon has a dead red pixel which is always on and what is worse is that the position of that red dot is right in the middle of the screen .
