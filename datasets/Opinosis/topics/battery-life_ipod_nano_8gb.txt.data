5G lies a more mature iPod, many steps wiser and more able than its one, year, old  The iPod gains many incremental improvements, including a brighter screen and better video battery life, but probably the most appealing aspect is the tantalizing price points of $249 for the 30GB version and $349 for the huge 80GB version   .
5GB and the better battery life rated for up to 6 .
 battery, not dummie proof  I love the color of this iPod .
 Battery life isn't amazing, Definitely need to get a case for it  I wanted to get a new iPod because I was upgrading from the mini .
 The battery doesn't last a long time especially when you're recording or watching a video but I just listen to music most of the time and it lasts me a good length of time doing that .

 good quality  light  long battery  portable  scratch resistant
 scratches easily, short battery life  I purchased this for my 6 year old son and he LOVES IT !
 Price battery replacement  The iPod basically does what Apple says it does .
 I do not like it that I will have to get Apple to eventually replace the battery .
 I think Apple's idea is that instead of replacing the battery, you will exchange it for a newer iPod .
 Make it inconvenient to replace the battery  make it convenient to replace the iPod .
 The Pedometer feature seems accurate, but a battery waster .

 It is easy to use and has great battery life .
 Thought would have longer battery life before recharge  This is my first iPOD but if endurance is as I expect will not be my last .
 The battery dies quickly and seems to die quicker in cold weather .
 Watching any videos drains the battery very quickly .
 Battery life is much better as well .
 Shorter battery life than old iPod, camera is in inconvenient spot  When I first listened to a song on this iPod, the first thing that caught my attention was the audio quality .
 One thing I noticed that was not so good was the battery life, but I've only charged it once and that was on the computer  as far as I've seen my computer doen't charge well with either of my iPods so the battery life is possibly greater than I thought if using a wall outlet .
 the battery life  this was an awsome christmas present and i love it its really easy to use and sounds great .
 this is my first ipod and its awsome the only thing i dont like is the battery life it lasts all day if you dont use it a lot but if you use it constantly like i do it only last about 4 or 5 hours not a big deal though .

 Battery Life  I bought this ipod to replace my 2nd gen 2gb ipod nano, because i filled that one's memory up .
 The only bad thing is it's battery life .
 8 hours or less is a more realistic battery life .
shoes if using vid cam for long time, it kills battery  Standard Def video recording, but still sharp !
 battery life, becuase of all the features  I had an apple ipod 3rd generation and the 5th genteration is twice as good as the numbering would suggest .
 I have not found one thing other than the battery life last for only one full day of use .
 So, the battery thing is not that big a deal .
 Overall, almost perfect just watch out or you will run out of battery life .
 battery life, freezes up  I just got the 5th gen as a replacement for my 2nd gen nano .
 the pedometer is also very nice but seems like it drains the battery if you have it in  always on  mode .
  The new Nano has a very short battery life most likely due to all the new features .
 Very easy to use, love the pedometer, lightweight, thin, nice screen, great sound, battery lasts much longer than stated  .
 Easy to use, Great sound, long battery life, love the fact that I can tune in to my favorite radio station, and I'm into exercise so the pedometer with calories burned is a great addition .
 Battery life seems to be good .
 Scratches easily and the battery does not last .
 The battery is not as strong as it should be .
 But the battery is a little bit unpleased, but it is very good .
 Battery life is bad, real bad .

 The video camera works great and the battery
 Then you find the battery only lasts about 1 .

I bought the nano as a replacement for an older classic, which was a great unit but time has taken it's toll on the battery and screen .
