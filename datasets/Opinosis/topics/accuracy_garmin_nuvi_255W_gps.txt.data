 The map is pretty accurate and the Point of interest database also is good .
 Most of the times, this info was very accurate .
I've even used it in the  pedestrian  mode, and it's amazing how accurate it is .

0 out of 5 stars GPS Navigator doesn't navigate accurately on a straight road .

0 out of 5 stars Inexpensive, accurate, plenty of features, August 6, 2009
 The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .
 I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .

 It has worked well for local driving giving accurate directions for roads and streets .
The estimated time to arrival does not seem to calculate the travelling time accurately .

 Accuracy is determined by the maps .

 Accuracy is within a few yards .
What the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .
