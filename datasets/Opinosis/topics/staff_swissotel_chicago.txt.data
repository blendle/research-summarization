 The staff at Swissotel were not particularly nice .
 Each time I waited at the counter for staff   for several minutes and then was waved to the desk upon my turn with no hello or anything, or apology for waiting in line .
 All staff members are very courteous and go the extra mile in meeting your needs during your stay .
 The staff was great and put us on the 30th floor with a view of the lake .
 The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the town and will go out of your way to be helpful .
 Our whole stay it felt like the staff went out of their way to make sure we had the best visit possible .

The staff is friendly enough and check in, check out went smoothly without incident .
 The front desk staff was not mean, but not very informative either .
 Some of the concierge staff were abit chilly at times, but the housekeeping service staff were extremely friendly and cheerful .
 The hotel was a bit busy during this weekend, but the staff did a great job of helping me with whatever I needed .
My only criticism would be that perhaps due to the size of the building and it was busy that staff appeared a bit impersonal .
 The Hotel staff were professional, but the fornt desk was somewhat slow at check in .
 My father and I were in town for four days from Los Angeles to catch a game at Wrigley Stadium, and the front desk and bar staff were all very friendly and accommodating, providing recommendations to us about the attractions, and transportation services .
 Instead we were offered a rude and incompetant staff, amateur and slow valet, over, priced internet, garage and fitness room access charges and an inept business office .
 Room 1619 was a very nice room, had a great view, beds were soft and very nice to sleep in, TV was very nice, show was very nice, staff was awesome saw to every need I inquired about .
STAFFHas that midwestern charm .
 The staff is quite accommodating .
I was very impressed with this hotel and its staff .
 The rooms were great, the staff was excellent .
 Very close to everything, or the front staff will hail a cab for you .
 You come to a place like Trip Advisor and it’s so, so hard to tell fact from fiction or even to tell whether or not someone was having a bad day when they arrived or left or whether or not a guest was rude him herself and thus caused the hotel staff to be standoffish or what .
 While we were there I would have to say I saw one or two people guests who were less than polite to the hotel staff .
 If you walk in feeling entitled with your nose up in the air like they owe you something, then I daresay you might find something to squawk about, but the hotel staff I encountered doesn’t sound anything like the staff some reviewers have mentioned .
Thanks to the management and staff for our fabulous weekend .
 The hotel was beautiful, clean, and the staff was wonderful .
 Some nice extras and the staff was very professional and most helpful .
 I compliment the hotel staff on their professionalism, their friendliness and their attention to detail .
 The concierge   staff was helpful and steered us in the direction of a great restaurant we could walk to .
 The several staff folks with whom I interacted were all lovely, including day &amp  night front desk, concierge, doorman, bartenders and restaurant servers .
 We appreciated the elegant service and manner of the staff .
 Where other hotel staff have sometimes acted &quot put out&quot  for being asked to board our luggage after checkout while we amused ourselves until flight time, Swissotel staff were charming and kind about taking it off our hands .
 The staff is always cheerful and helpful upon arrival and during my stay .
 The staff is more than accomadating and will take care of any need you might have .

 The hotel staff tend to be aware of the tourist traps since they are close by .
Great Facility and Location ,  So, So Staff .
My one issue was with the staff .
 The front desk staff were friendly and relatively efficient but utterly lacked any warmth   .
 Staff was very accomodating .
 I always tip housekeeping and the staff never disappointed .
front desk staff need customer service 101 .
The front desk staff was never very helpful when we had any requests for simple things .
 Why is the cleaning staff telling us they are out of coffee for the rooms ?
 If you dont mind the attitude of dealing with a rude staff, go for it .
 Overall would stay elsewhrere downtown to many other properties who offer nicer staff assistance, quality for the price .
 The staff seemed very helpful and friendly .
 The hotel staff was not helpful at all .

 Swissotel Chicago is good hotel, very nice, very helpful and nice staff .
The staff at the hotel is efficient although they didn’t distinguish themselves from other higher, end hotels .
 The front desk staff can be clueless about this stuff, too, just handing you attitude if you complain .
 At checkin, the staff never made eye contact and only went through the motions .
 Bell staff was attentive and available .
 From the moment we checked in, the staff was courteous and meet every need, including arranging for a crib for our daughter and making sure it was safely set up before leaving our room .
However, the staff was very friendly and helpful .
 The young lady that checked us in was very pleasant and I was very appreciative of the articulate directions given to us by one of the staff members .
 Check, in and check, out were a breeze  , and the staff was just fine .
 My biggest complaint is I got used to the Fairmont's treatment, the staff is very well trained to meet your every need and are over accomodating .
 I guess the thing that bothers me most is that from the lobby decor and staff attitudes, this hotel is trying to be very snooty but then you go to your room and it is a piece of junk !
 We found the staff to be helpful and friendly .
 The hotel is in a great location, the staff is friendly and very service, oriented .

 we had such a memorable time in Chicago, and i would like to thank the staff of the Swissotel for making it such .
the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !
 All the staff at the hotel were the epitomy of politeness and professionalism .
 The staff was absolutely excellent = full service, from front desk, to health club attendants, to business center personnel .
Staff are welcoming, room was spacious, spotless, and quality .
 And the front desk staff dealt with folks with a general disdain   .
 The other big gripe was with the reception staff, who were rude .
 The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful, switching our room to one with 2 double beds from a king, even suggesting local restaurants to eat at just a short walk away .
 The bell staff was happy to hold my bags till I returned .
 Front desk staff was not pleasant at all and did not bother to satisfy our room preferences .
 Very classy entrance, nice staff .
 From checking to checking out, I loved the room and the staff .
 Everything was wonderful, including the staff and service .
 Now on the side of the service andstaff, there is a real &quot snobbish&quot  attitude that isprobably related to the fact that the Swedish, Germanprogeny of Europe work at the hotel, except as luggagehandlers, toilet cleaners and car parkers .
 The front desk staff was friendly as well .
 The location of the hotel is also good and the staff seemed friendly .
The hotel seemed understaffed at the front desk as there was only one agent when I checked in .
 I thought that the concierge staff was OK, certainly not too pleasant, but adequate .
 Of course I called downstairs and was put on endless hold due to them not being staffed sufficiently .
 It's a block away from the Hyatt which I have also stayed at and isn't as nice as the Swissotel but at least its better staffed .
 I agree with other reviewers who found the staff to be efficient, but not terribly personable .
Hotel is staff is courteous on the most part .

 Swissotel has a famous restaurant inside it and the staff in there are charming and attentive .
 Service was great as I was greeted immediately by bellstaff from my taxi and the desk person greeted me with a great smile .
 Staff seemed efficient though not overly friendly, no good morning, etc .
 The worst were the clorox, like smell on that floor and the level of service provided by the staff .
 The staff is not helpful and sometimes hardly able to understand even a simple English sentence .
Back in the room, the cleaning staff never made it there before 4pm in the afternoon, not very exciting when you have to spend a rainy weekend in the windy city !
 And due to the lack of a sign, you cannot indicate to the cleaning staff early in the day that the room is ready .
 Extremely helpful staff, a very quiet, clean and safe property .
 FIrst at check in the desk staff individuals were a bit rude and almost seemed to be looking down at people who are not business travelers .
 I did not find the service staff to be above average in any way, with the exception of the lovely concierge .

 They brought up an extra robe for our child upon request and when the ice machine was broke on the surrounding floors around us, the hotel staff went and got our ice for us !
 The staff who answered the phone was happy to hang around so that he could complete his business .
 The staff is quite unfriendly and unaccomodating .
 The staff at the front desk were very helpful and friendly and couldn't have done more for us .
 potential, but is probably in need of a renovation and some intense customer service training for its staff .
Staff was courteous without being &quot over the top&quot  and was responsive to all requests .
