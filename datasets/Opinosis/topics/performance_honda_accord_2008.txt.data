Very happy with my 08 Accord, performance is quite adequate it has nice looks and is a great long,  distance cruiser .
 6, 4, 3 eco engine has poor performance and gas mileage of 22 highway .
 Overall performance is good but comfort level is poor .
 I'm impressed with the performance as well as efficiency gains .
 It has room, performance, good MPG for its size and excellent reliability .
 For the record I test, drove the Lexus350 the BMW 5 series, the infiniti G35 and enjoyed the Honda performance equally for far less money !
 Very happy with the car enjoy the ride and performance .
 The performance of the engine is very smooth .
 This car had rattles at 500 miles and has horrible performance even for a four cylinder .
 Great performance and handling make this a real Winner !
 Engine performance lacks punch after 60, head rest are poor design, lacks driver seat memory rear seat a c, radio system is marginal compared to Bose, Seats are hard and small for a large person .
 There seem to be so many components that enter into the VCM that performance can vary WIDELY from car to car .
Features, quality, reliability, and performance, at a price no other car maker can touch .
 190 HP engine is a good compromise for performance and fuel economy .
I owned this car for only a week, but I am pleasantly surprised by its performance and build quality .
This car lacks the performance and handling of previous years .
 Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .
 Still enjoy interior and exterior styling as well as overall performance and handling .
 I just put it on the highway this weekend and its performance was amazing !
 The bigger size has taken some getting used to, but the additional horsepower compared to the '02 and the performance are like night and day .
 It fits right , is fun to drive, great stereo, fuel economy, performance .
 If you want sports sedan handling and performance, then pay much more and buy a true sports sedan !
 I went for comfort over performance to fit it in my budget so the EX, L with the 4 cyl engine .
 I researched many other makes and models but for the performance, quality, and style, the accord won hands down for cars under $32,000 .
 Performance is outstanding, more like a sports car than a coupe .
 Lots of power with the 6 spd, and the car has a great balance of style, performance, and   reliability .
 No problem with quality, performance, etc .
 Engine performance is very lacking .
t anywhere close to 3 series on many facets, namely performance, but sadly to say, in others, it surpasses .
 The 4 cylinder lacks performance and handling and the gas saving is only minimal .
 The car is great, both with styling and performance .
 I purchased a 2004 V6,  Leather and I did not think Honda could do any better with design or performance .
 I love the styling the performance and handling .
I was looking for a luxury, feel car with great performance at a good price .
Overweight ,  3600 pounds, lots of road noise, and the combined performance of the VCM and the grade logic automatic transmission mke this a miserable driver .
 The interior design and the performance of the V6 are the highlights .
I was looking for a mid size coupe with style, performance and all season traction capability .
Styling in and out is fantastic, and the v, 6 performance is all one would hope for and more .
 It does not diminish the performance of the car, it is just annoying .
After tracking almost 2 months of research on American and Japanese mid, size car models, only two stands out for their performance, reliability and safety ,  Honda Accord and Toyota Camry .
 My my, I have never experienced such smooth performance, stability, pick, up, mileage and comfort that I am enjoying with my new 2008 Honda Accord .
 I admire engine performance and comfort while driving atleast 30 mile a day to job .
I have owned 4 honda's and have come to rely on the fantastic quality of performance and lack of maintenance issues .
 The car is superb, performance, styling, quality, engineering, fit and finish , the whole banana  !
 The performance is incredible !
 Gas mileage is great for a vehicle with this type of performance .
 I could not be happier with the performance and ride of this car .
 When I first tested the EX, L V6, the performance and handling of the car sold me,  I had to get it and I did .
 Honda has outdone itself on styling and performance .
 Its ride, comfort and overall performance is an absolute joy .
 The previous models were boring both aestically and performance wise .
